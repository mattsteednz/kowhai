# Changelog

All notable changes to AudioVault are documented here.

## [1.6.3] — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Drive book stuck in "undownloaded" state after download completes** — After a download finished, the book details screen would re-show the download prompt when tapping "Start listening" instead of opening the player. The details screen was reading file presence from the stale `Audiobook` object passed at navigation time rather than the live event-driven counts. It now uses download event counts (sourced from the DB via `DriveBookRepository`) to determine whether a book is fully downloaded, so the state always reflects reality.
- **Stale audioFiles when navigating to player post-download** — When "Start listening" is tapped after a download completes on the details screen, the fresh book (with actual audio file paths) is now fetched from `DriveLibraryService` before opening the player, preventing the player from opening with an empty playlist.
- **Silent failure swallowed in library refresh** — Errors thrown by `_refreshDriveBook` after a download event were silently dropped (unawaited fire-and-forget). Errors are now caught and logged, and `_applySort` is properly awaited so the library grid reliably updates when a download finishes.

## [1.6.2] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Download prompt shows file size on WiFi** — The "Download" bottom sheet now always fetches and displays the book's file size regardless of connection type. Previously the size was only shown on mobile data; on WiFi the prompt showed a generic message with no size and an unlabelled "Download" button.
- **"Start listening" on undownloaded Drive book** — Tapping "Start listening" on the book details screen for a Drive book that hasn't been downloaded no longer opens the player with no audio. It now shows the same download prompt as the library screen, including the file size.

### Internal

- Extracted `showDriveDownloadSheet` from `LibraryScreen` into `lib/utils/drive_download_sheet.dart` so both the library and book details screens share the same prompt logic.
- Moved `formatBytes` from `library_screen.dart` to `lib/utils/formatters.dart`.

---

## [1.6.1] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed

- **Drive onboarding scan** — Selecting a Google Drive folder during onboarding now immediately triggers a scan; new users no longer see an empty library that requires a manual rescan.
- **Download icon visibility** — Drive book download icon now sits inside a semi-transparent dark circle, making it visible on light-coloured covers.
- **Sleep timer sheet** — Now scrollable on small screens; all options including Custom… are reachable without the sheet expanding to full height.
- **Speed sheet** — Removed Cancel/Done buttons; dismissing keeps the last-set speed, consistent with other player sheets. Title left-aligned.
- **Library filter/sort sheets** — Aligned to player sheet style (manual drag handle, `titleMedium`, `SafeArea`). Sort sheet Cancel button removed — dismiss by backdrop tap or drag.
- **Player "remaining overall" label** — Shortened to "left".

### Changed

- **Placeholder tile colours** — Switched from dark jewel tones to lighter muted mid-tones, less overpowering on the light theme.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **Player screen streamlined** — App bar title removed; bookmarks moved to an app bar icon alongside book details and Cast. The player body is less cluttered and the title/author/chapter info section carries more visual weight.
- **Speed sheet** — Replaced Cancel/Done buttons with immediate live-apply on dismiss, consistent with the sleep timer and bookmarks sheets. Title is now left-aligned.
- **Sleep timer sheet** — Now scrollable via a constrained `ListView`, so all options (including Custom…) are reachable on small screens without the sheet expanding to full height.

### Internal

- Extracted `SpeedDialog`, `ChapterListSheet`, `CastPickerDialog`, `LibraryOverflowMenu`, and `MiniPlayer` widgets from their parent screens.
- Extracted `M4bChapterParser` into a dedicated service with full test coverage.
- Added 30 s HTTP timeout to all Drive API calls.
- Fixed download manager fallback path to use `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` instead of `/tmp`.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Progress sync** — Positions are automatically backed up to `positions.json` in the audiobooks root folder (within 30 s of any change, immediately on app background). An optional "Sync progress to Drive" toggle in Settings uploads the backup to an `AudioVault/` subfolder in a chosen Drive location; on first launch with an empty database and sync enabled, positions are silently restored from Drive. Drive write access is requested only when the toggle is turned on.
- **metadata.opf support** — When scanning a book folder, AudioVault reads a `metadata.opf` file (Calibre/OverDrive format) if present. OPF values take precedence over embedded audio tags for title, author, narrator, description, publisher, language, release date, and series. Series is displayed as e.g. "The Stormlight Archive #1" in book details. Narrator is shown in the player below the author.
- **Chapter bookmarks** — Bookmark any moment while listening. Tap the Bookmarks chip in the player bottom row to view or add bookmarks for the current book. Name and Notes fields are optional; an unnamed bookmark defaults to `Chapter X — H:MM:SS`. Bookmarks appear in the book details screen; tapping one jumps to the player at that position. Swipe-to-delete in both locations.

### Security

- **Cast server session token** — The local HTTP server now generates a random 16-byte hex token per Cast session. All served URLs embed the token; requests without it return 404, preventing other LAN devices from accessing audio files while casting.

### Accessibility

- Semantic labels on player transport controls, play/pause, chapter label, and speed chip; tooltips on all icon buttons; decorative badges (now playing, finished, DRM) labelled for screen readers; settings dialog rows meet the 48dp touch target minimum; large-text (2×) widget tests added.

### Internal

- Enrichment cancellation now aborts in-flight HTTP requests immediately via `http.Client.close()`.
- `ScannerService.maxScanDepth` constant documented and boundary-tested.
- `PositionService._deriveStatus` extracted as a shared helper.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-04-19

### Changed

- **Library header redesign** — The AppBar is pared back to Sleep Timer, Search, and a ⋯ overflow menu (Listen history, Rescan library, Settings). The title "My Library" is always fully visible.
- **Inline search bar** — Tapping Search expands an animated search bar below the header instead of replacing the title.
- **View bar** — A new pinned row below the header shows the filtered book count and active filter/sort summary, with grid/list toggle on the left and Filter + Sort buttons on the right.
- **Filter and Sort bottom sheets** — Progress filtering moves into a Filter sheet with an explicit "All" pill as the default. Sort moves into its own sheet — a simple list with a check against the active option and a Cancel action. Both sheets auto-apply on tap.
- **Coloured placeholder tiles** — Books without cover art now render as deterministic jewel-tone tiles allocated sequentially across the grid/list so adjacent placeholders never share a colour. The default book icon has been removed for a cleaner look.
- **Frosted-glass mini player** — The mini player uses a backdrop blur so it reads as a floating layer above the library content.
- **Drive tiles** — Removed the dark scrim over undownloaded Drive books; the download icon sits directly on the cover/placeholder for a lighter visual weight.

### Removed

- The old filter chip row above the library grid (replaced by the Filter sheet).
- The standalone sort icon, view-toggle icon, rescan icon, history icon, and settings icon in the AppBar (consolidated into the ⋯ menu and view bar).

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added

- **Library sort menu** — New sort picker in the library AppBar with Last played, Title (A–Z), Author (A–Z), Date added, and Duration (longest first). Selection persists across launches.
- **Sleep timer indicator outside the player** — A small countdown chip appears in the library AppBar when a sleep timer is running, so you can see remaining time without opening the player. Tap it to jump back into the current book.
- **Visual feedback during cover enrichment** — Books being enriched in the background show a subtle loading indicator on their cover until the new artwork arrives.
- **Playback error recovery** — Playback errors now surface a toast with a retry action instead of silently failing.
- **Startup loading labels** — The initial library scan screen now labels what it's doing (scanning folder, syncing Drive, etc.) so long waits aren't opaque.

### Changed

- **Combined search + filter empty state** — When a search query and a status filter both return nothing, the empty state names both constraints and offers a single "Clear filters" action.
- **Drive sign-in logs** — User email is no longer included in debug logs; sign-in and session-restore events log a generic status string instead.
- **Cast init errors** — Google Cast initialisation failures are now logged instead of being silently swallowed.

### Fixed

- **Library empty on launch when refresh-on-startup is off** — Previously discovered books (local and Drive) now load from cache on app open even when automatic rescan is disabled. Only the Drive network sync is skipped.

### Internal

- Extracted `PositionPersister`, `CastController`, `DriveRemovalScheduler`, and `MediaStateBroadcaster` out of `AudioVaultHandler`. PRD-12 archived.
- Extracted pure helpers from `LibraryScreen` (status filter, last-played sort, byte formatting) and `DriveDownloadManager` (queue-selection decision). Scanner recursion depth named, `unawaited` standardised, position-service status derivation DRY'd.
- 52+ new tests across Drive services, book repository, and player helpers. No behaviour change.

---

## [1.2.5] — 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Background library resync** — Existing books stay visible while a rescan runs. Local books stream into the list one by one as the scanner finds them; Drive books merge in at the end. Stale books are removed and the list re-sorts once at completion. The player remains fully accessible throughout.
- **Refresh library on startup** — New toggle in Settings (off by default). When off, the app opens instantly with no scan; tap the refresh button to scan manually. When on, a full scan runs every time the app opens.
- **Deep folder nesting** — The scanner now supports author/series grouping folders up to three levels deep (e.g. `Audiobooks / Author / Series / Book`), so libraries organised with an extra folder layer are fully indexed.
- **Book details screen** — Long-press a book to open a details sheet showing cover, title, author, format, file count, and total duration. Drive books include download/remove controls.

### Changed

- **Sync indicator** — The full-width `LinearProgressIndicator` bar is replaced by a spinning refresh icon in the AppBar, keeping the visual footprint minimal while a rescan is in progress.

### Fixed

- **Drive: cover preserved on undownload** — Removing a downloaded Drive book no longer clears its cover art in the library list.
- **Drive: stale download queue cleared on re-download** — Pending file entries from a previous failed download are removed before starting a fresh download attempt.
- **Drive: cover-only overlay** — Download progress overlay on book cards is now suppressed for cover-file events so it doesn't flash "downloaded" prematurely.
- **Drive: auto-retry failed downloads** — Individual file downloads retry up to 3 times before marking as failed; a 30-second per-chunk timeout prevents stalled transfers from blocking the queue.
- **Drive: onboarding** — Selecting only a Drive folder on first launch no longer shows "No library folder set".

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added

- **Book status tracking** — Each book is automatically tracked as Not started, In progress, or Finished. Status is derived from playback position for existing books and stored explicitly once set.
- **Status filter pills** — Filter the library by Not started, In progress, or Finished.
- **Finished badge** — A checkmark badge appears on book covers and list tiles for finished books.
- **Drive: Remove when finished** — New toggle in Settings. When enabled, downloaded audio files are deleted 1 minute after a book finishes, freeing storage while keeping the book in the library as Finished.
- **Disable autoplay on open** — Opening the player screen no longer auto-starts playback.

### Changed

- `PositionService` migrated to DB schema v3, adding a `status` column to the `positions` table.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Library search** — Filter books by title or author with an inline search bar.
- **Fine-grained playback speed** — Speed chip opens a dialog with a 0.5×–3.0× slider and quick-select chips. Live preview while dragging; Cancel reverts.
- **Custom skip interval** — New "Skip interval" setting (10 / 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 s).
- **Custom sleep timer** — "Custom…" option opens a 1–180 minute picker.

### Fixed

- **Player times blank on reopen** — Reopening the player for a paused book now shows the correct elapsed time, remaining time, and scrubber position immediately.

### Changed

- **Auto-rescan on folder change** — Changing the audiobooks folder in Settings triggers a library rescan immediately.
- **Enrichment cache flush on rescan** — When enrichment is disabled, rescanning ignores previously cached covers and reverts books to embedded artwork.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-04-09

### Added

- **About screen** — App info, licences, and links accessible from the bottom of Settings.
- **App icon** — Custom vault-door icon across all Android mipmap densities with adaptive foreground layer.

### Fixed

- **`path_provider_android` pinned to 2.2.23** — Prevents NDK-dependent versions from crashing the scanner at runtime.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-08

### Added

- **Smart rewind on resume** — Playback automatically rewinds when you resume after a break: 10 s after 5 min, 15 s after 1 hour, 30 s after 24 hours.
- **Full Cast playback routing** — All playback controls route to the Cast device when a Cast session is active.
- **VPN warning in Cast picker** — A warning banner is shown when a VPN connection is detected.

### Fixed

- Chapter index off-by-one at boundaries; mini player position during Cast; hidden files excluded from scan.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Google Cast support** — Stream to any Chromecast or Cast-enabled speaker from the player.
- **M4B chapter support** — Single-file M4B audiobooks with embedded QuickTime chapter tracks display a navigable chapter list.
- **Light/dark/system theme** — Color mode setting persisted and applied live.
- **Metadata enrichment** — Background cover art fetching from Open Library for books without artwork.

### Fixed

- Chapter time labels; M4B chapter parsing; natural file sort; sleep timer off-by-one; mini player progress; history screen unreachable; playback completion position save.
