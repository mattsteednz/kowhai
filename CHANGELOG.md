# Changelog

All notable changes to AudioVault are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Google Cast support** — Cast button in the player AppBar opens a device picker to start or stop casting to nearby Google Cast devices.
- **Chapter list for M4B books** — Single-file M4B audiobooks with embedded QuickTime chapter tracks now display a tappable "Chapter X of Y" label and a navigable chapter list sheet, matching the existing experience for multi-file MP3 books.
- **Light/dark/system theme** — Color mode setting (Follow system / Light / Dark), persisted and applied live without restarting the app. Theme is read before the first frame to avoid a flash on launch.
- **Metadata enrichment** — New `EnrichmentService` fetches missing cover art from [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org) in the background after a library scan. Covers are downloaded to the app cache and persisted in a separate SQLite database (`audiovault_enrichment.db`). Already-enriched books are skipped; failed lookups are retried no more than once per day.
- **"Get missing covers & metadata" toggle** — Settings switch (enabled by default) to start or stop background enrichment. Turning it off immediately cancels any in-progress queue.
- **`Audiobook.copyWith`** — Immutable helper on the `Audiobook` model for updating `coverImagePath` or `coverImageBytes` without recreating the full object.
- **`BookCover` widget** — Shared widget for rendering cover art (image or placeholder icon), replacing duplicated `_cover`/`_placeholder` methods across five files.
- **`AudioHandlerScope` InheritedWidget** — Provides `audioHandler` and `themeModeNotifier` via the widget tree, replacing the top-level global variable.

### Fixed

- **Chapter time labels** — The time display below the player progress bar now shows elapsed and remaining time within the current chapter (`mm:ss` / `-mm:ss`) rather than the global book position and total duration. Both labels update in lock-step on the same second boundary.
- **M4B chapter parsing** — Single-file M4B audiobooks with QuickTime chapter tracks (iTunes/Audible format) now correctly parse and display chapter information. `co64` (64-bit chunk offsets) is also supported for future-proofing.
- **Natural file sort** — Audio files inside a folder are now sorted by the natural numeric order of their filenames (e.g. `2.mp3 < 10.mp3 < 100.mp3`) instead of lexicographic order, fixing chapter sequencing for multi-file audiobooks.
- **Audio stream error handling** — Added `onError` callbacks to `playbackEventStream` and `currentIndexStream` listeners so playback errors are logged rather than silently swallowed.
- **Sleep timer off-by-one** — Timer now decrements before checking the zero threshold, so a 5-minute timer runs for exactly 5 minutes.
- **Mini player progress** — Fixed mini player progress bar showing per-file progress instead of global book progress for multi-file audiobooks.
- **History screen unreachable** — Wired up the history button in the library AppBar; the screen was fully implemented but had no navigation path.
- **Playback completion** — Position is now saved when `processingState` reaches `completed`, so resume works correctly after finishing a book.
- **M4B notification chapter count** — Fixed notification metadata reporting 1 chapter (the file count) instead of the actual embedded chapter count.

### Changed

- **Settings screen redesigned** — Each setting now uses an icon + title + current-value subtitle layout. Color mode opens a dialog picker (icon, label, and checkmark for the active selection). Section groups are separated by plain dividers with no header labels.
- `chapterIndexAt` logic moved from `AudioVaultHandler` and `PlayerScreen` into the `Audiobook` model to eliminate duplication.
- `PreferencesService` is now a proper singleton with a cached `SharedPreferences` instance.
- `PreferencesService` gains `getThemeMode` / `setThemeMode` and `getMetadataEnrichment` / `setMetadataEnrichment` methods.
- Position is saved on `stop()` to prevent losing progress when the OS kills the audio service.
- Library scan now applies previously cached covers immediately (before enrichment runs) so the UI is populated from the first render.
- Completed PRDs moved to `prd/done/`.

### Dependencies

- Added `http: ^1.2.0` for Open Library API requests.
